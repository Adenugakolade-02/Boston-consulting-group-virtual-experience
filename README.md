# Boston-consulting-group-virtual-experience
This repository contains solutions to the tasks given Boston consulting group virtual experience program.

The program is aimed at giving me a real world experience of task performed by Data scientist and it  took me through the steps of
  1. Business understanding & problem framing: understanding the context of the customer and the problem theyâ€™re trying to solve with data
  2. Exploratory data analysis & data cleaning: understanding the customers' data and its statistical properties as well as preparing a dataset for further analysis
  3. Feature engineering: using business context and expertise to create new data that may provide useful signals in the prediction of outcomes
  4. Modeling and evaluation: Using your engineered dataset to model an outcome and generate predictions. Then, testing these predictions against the ground truth to see       whether they are reliable.
  5. Insights & Recommendations: turning the insights of this analysis into business decisions and recommendations.
